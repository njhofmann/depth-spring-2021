1. set up dataloader pipelines for sun rgb-d data bounding boxes
   1. boundary conditions
1. set up models with work with any # of channels
1. look at depth operators in detail
    1. easily interchangeable with conv2d?
    1. max extension?
1. setup convolutional operators
   1. integrate with existing models
1. baseline experiments for semantic segmentation and object recognition
1. get additional datasets set up...?
1. convolutional experiments

1. Saving models in pipeline?
