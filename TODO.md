1. writing
   1. catch up on basic docs
   1. basic readme
   1. credit
1. set up object detection eval 
   1. set up dataloader pipelines for sun rgb-d data bounding boxes
      1. boundary conditions
   1. evaluation metrics?
1. fix runtime warnings
      1. true divide line 30 & 32
      1. numpy loading
1. set up depth operators
    1. integrate with existing models

    1. max extension?
    1. finish setting up
1. baseline experiments for semantic segmentation and object recognition
1. get additional datasets set up...?
1. convolutional experiments
